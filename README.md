## Overview
This project involves analyzing weather data and planning vacations based on weather conditions. The project is divided into two main parts:

### Weather Analysis
In the Weather Analysis notebook, we:
- Collected weather data from various cities around the world using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Performed linear regression analysis to explore the relationships between different weather parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed) and latitude.
- Visualized the data using scatter plots and regression lines to identify trends and patterns.

### Vacation Planning
In the Vacation Planning notebook, we:
- Filtered cities based on ideal weather conditions for a vacation (e.g., temperature range, humidity, cloudiness).
- Used the Google Maps API to locate hotels in the selected cities.
- Created a map with markers indicating the locations of the hotels and the weather conditions.

## Key Findings
- **Temperature vs. Latitude**: There is a clear inverse relationship between latitude and temperature, with temperatures generally decreasing as one moves away from the equator.
- **Humidity vs. Latitude**: The relationship between humidity and latitude is less pronounced, indicating that other factors also significantly influence humidity levels.
- **Cloudiness vs. Latitude**: The data shows variability in cloudiness with latitude, but no strong linear trend.
- **Wind Speed vs. Latitude**: Wind speed shows some variation with latitude, but the relationship is not strong, suggesting that local weather systems and topography play a significant role.
